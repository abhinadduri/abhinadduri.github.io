Hello! I am a 5th year Ph.D. Candidate at CMU advised by [Dr. Hosein Mohimani](http://mohimanilab.cbd.cmu.edu/). My research focus is on developing and applying high performance computing techniques and AI for computational drug discovery.

Organisms in nature such as bacteria or fungi can produce drugs that can benefit humanity, but as of now, finding these drugs is laborious and mostly trial and error. Since DNA largely dictates the characteristics of organisms, my research started with the question: can we examine the DNA of microbes to reliably predict the drug-like compounds they will create? And, can we characterize whether they will be useful to humans as antibiotics, antifungals, or even as cancer therapeutics? 

Our lab is using the latest in LLMs and bioinformatics to answer these questions, starting from DNA and ending with wet lab validation of our results. We are working with *Nature* to publish our most recent discovery: an antifungal that we discovered which kills a drug-resistant 
fungal strain that the CDC considers an urgent threat, which we've validated in mouse models. To address the need for high performance in this field, we make heavy use of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), which in tandem with efficient algorithm design has led to order of magnitude improvements in runtimes.

I am also interested in using self-supervised techniques on multi-modal biological data to tackle problems downstream of drug discovery, such as drug-target interaction prediction and building a foundation model for mass spectra to improve molecule-spectra matching.

Before starting my Ph.D., I majored in Computer Science at UC Berkeley.

| Mozilla          | Portland, OR         |    May 2017 - August 2017    | Designed and wrote [Firefox Send](https://github.com/mozilla/send), a peer-to-peer, private file sharing app with 13.2k stars and 1.6k forks on github. Send was covered by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2017/08/04/firefox-makers-new-app-makes-secure-file-sharing-a-breeze/?sh=65fd86b71d03), TechRepublic, etc, but was eventually shutdown in 2020 due to [malicious users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_Send). The engine I wrote has been reused in multiple open source projects, such as [ffsend](https://github.com/timvisee/ffsend), and Mozilla has since resurrected the project as [Thunderbird Send](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/thunderbird/addon/filelink-provider-for-send/).       |
| Rubrik           | Palo Alto, CA        |    May 2018 - August 2018    | Designed and implemented a distributed cache system for the filesystems team, and designed RPCs to expose the node cache space.                                     |
| Square / Caviar  | San Francisco, CA    |    May 2019 - August 2019    | Improved pre-checkout food delivery ETA predictions, and improved recall / precision of fraud detection models by 3.5x / 2.5x respectively.                         |
