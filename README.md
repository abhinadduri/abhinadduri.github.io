Hello! I am a 5th year Ph.D. Candidate in the Computational Biology Department at CMU advised by [Dr. Hosein Mohimani](http://mohimanilab.cbd.cmu.edu/).

My focus is on using AI / ML techniques and algorithms for natural drug discovery. Organisms in nature such as bacteria or fungi can produce drugs that can benefit humankind, but as of now, finding these drugs is laborious and mostly trial and error. 

Since DNA largely dictates the characteristics of organisms, my research started with the question: can we examine the DNA of microbes to reliably predict the drug-like compounds they will create? And, can we characterize whether they will be useful to humans as antibiotics, antifungals, or even as cancer therapeutics? 

Our lab is using the latest in LLMs and bioinformatics to answer these questions, starting from DNA and ending with wet lab validation of our results. We are working with *Nature* to publish our most recent discovery: an antifungal that we discovered which kills a drug-resistant 
fungal strain that the CDC considers an urgent threat.

I am also working on using self-supervised techniques on multi-modal biological data to tackle problems such as drug-target interaction and matching small molecules to their mass spectra.
